# MessengerNow
This project is an android project developed by Ange Bagui from LES TEACHERS DU NET (A [Youtube Channel](http://youtube.com/hounwanou1993) about programming and other fun stuff) with the video series about parse.com and material design.
So we will show you how to develop a kind of whatsapp clone using Parse and the Android Design Support Library.

#Parse
Parse.com is a powerful plateform that creates the backend for the mobile developer in the cloud.
Parse give us a data storage, push notifcation, hosting, cloud code and much more.

#Material Design
At this time, I'm making this tutorial the latest version of Android is M. So we have to design a beautiful app, with NavigationView, Floating Action Button, CoordinatorLayout,
Snackbar, Tabs, motion, and scrolling, Collapsing Toolbars, RecyclerView, etc.

Feel free to contribute. That's the power of the Open Source World :).
